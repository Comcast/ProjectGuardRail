## Baseline: 

Baseline requirements are the minimum set of requirements that <b>all AI/ML systems</b> should meet. 

There are 28 questions that should be filled out by the development team/ML engineer for the application. The last question is specific to Generative AI applications only. 

Questions highlight in <b>bold</b> indicate those which require minor testing before the question can be answered.

|                       | Is the training data to the model verified for completeness? If there are variables we cannot collect due to dataset restrictions, are they documented? <br> _Ensure that there are no missing variables required for prediction or incomplete data with missing values. Missing values should be handled using proper statistical approaches. Furthermore, changes to the data must be reviewed before direct addition. This is important so that malicious values cannot be inserted into the training data._ |

|                       | Is there a recovery plan in case training data is contaminated? <br>  _This would ideally mean having a process to recover the training data and retrain a model in case it does not behave as intended._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Model**                 | Is the model explainable? <br> _Though explainability is broad, for now, we mean documenting the (i) the purpose, (ii) model functionality (how the model works), including type of algorithm used, and, (iii) accuracy with test cases._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                       | In case the model is using confidential information (personal information or proprietary information), is there a warning/notification in place to limit unchecked predictions? <br>  _For instance, if the AI/ML model is recommending a higher broadband plan, it should come with a warning that recommends consulting with a representative before making a change based on AI/ML output alone. If not, it can potentially have a wrong prediction in case the user received a manipulated output._          |
