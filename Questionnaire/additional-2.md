## Additional - 2 - User Data Interaction: 

Additional-2 requirements are a set of requirements that must be met <b> in addition to baseline if an AI/ML application if it is either using user data as input to the model or interacting with end-users </b> in some way. 

There are 19 questions in total, all of them being yes/no questions that should be filled out by the development team/ML engineer for the application. The last 3 questions are specific to generative AI applications only. 

Questions highlighted in <b>bold</b> indicate those which require minor testing before the question can be answered.

| **Generative AI**   |
||
| **Artefact**   | Do you check the scope of the output of the model? Can there be cases where the output can be counterproductive for users? <br>  _To prevent this, typically models limit the scope of what they produce as output. For example, a retail customer service chatbot should not provide healthcare information._      |	
| | Can the AI/ML system automatically make decisions for a user without involving the user in the process? <br>  _For example, if there is an AI/ML system processing that some customers use more data than their original plan, can it automatically enroll them into a higher data plan without consulting the customer?_     |	
||
| **Model** | Does the AI system automatically label users? Do you check for correctness in the labels? <br>  _Incorrect labeling can lead to incorrect predictions._ |
